VM password: `cav2021`

=== Web interface

Isla can also be used via an online web interface, available at:
https://isla-axiomatic.cl.cam.ac.uk. This website has some limitations
as compared with the tool being run locally, as it can only be used in
some pre-configured configurations, and has various resource
limits.

=== Basic instructions

The home directory of this virtual machine image contains various
scripts which can be used to run various sets of litmus tests. For
example, to run the AArch64 thread tests, the following command can be
used:

[source,bash]
----
artifact@artifact-VirtualBox:~$ ./test_litmus_aarch64_2_thread.sh 2
----

The number after the script tells it how many tests to run in
parallel, and can be adjusted based on your hardware and how many
cores are available to the virtual machine.

On the virtual machine some tests can run much slower than on actual
hardware, so some tests may timeout. The timeout option in the scripts
can be adjusted if necessary.

=== Running individual tests

The various isla commands should be available in a terminal window by
default, so to run a single test:

[source,bash]
----
artifact@artifact-VirtualBox:~$ isla-axiomatic -A isla-snapshots/aarch64.ir -C isla/configs/aarch64.toml -m models/aarch64.cat -t litmus-tests-armv8a-private/tests/non-mixed-size/BASIC_2_THREAD/MP.litmus
----

To view an image of the allowed execution of this test, append the
`--view` option to this command.

Inside the virtual machine image we have reference results for the
various included tests, produced by RMEM, to compare the tool's output
against these, the `--refs AArch64.model_logs` option can be used, or
similarly for RISC-V. See the section below for a detailed description
of the various command line options.

=== Sample commands

The virtual machine contains two scripts on the desktop that should
launch a terminal and run various example commands. The first,
`run_example_tests.sh` will run a set of sample tests in batch mode,
as shown:

The second `run_example_image.sh` will evaluate a single litmus test,
and display its execution graph in an image viewer:

=== Installing locally

Isla is written primarily in Rust, and is available on crates.io:
https://crates.io/crates/isla. If cargo is installed (via `apt
install cargo` on Ubuntu), then it should be possible to download and
build Isla with just:

[source,bash]
----
cargo install isla
----

Similarly, if you want to build the current latest version from
github, it should be as simple as downloading the
link:https://github.com/rems-project/isla[github repository] and using:

[source,bash]
----
cargo build --release
----

NOTE: The version of the Isla used for this artifact is available on
the `cav2021artifact` branch of our github repository, and the crates.io
version may differ.

The compiled executables will then be placed in the `target/release`
subdirectory.

The one major caveat to this is we require
link:https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3[z3] to be installed as a shared
library. On Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS or newer, the z3 version in the
repositories should just work after using `apt install z3
libz3-dev`. However the version of z3 that is available in older
Ubuntu LTS versions (and likely other Linux distros) is quite old, so
you may experience link errors in that case. The build.rs script is
configured so it can use a `libz3.so` shared library placed in the
root directory of the Isla repository. If this is done then
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must also be set when executing
so that the more recent z3 shared library is used.
